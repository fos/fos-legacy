Actors
======

Fos includes various actors (visualization objects) for visualization.
They expose an easy interface for creation, usually using Numpy arrays.
Two classes of actors are defined:

Static actors
  For static structures that do not evolve in time.
  
Dynamic actors
  One, or more parameters can have a time dimension, making the actor
  evolving dynamically.
